                    <div class="project-name">Electrecity</div>
                    <p>One day, while watching lightning during a thunderstorm, I, Manat, thought about the nature of this phenomenon. Inspired by its strength and beauty, I began experimenting with different materials in my small workshop. After several months of trial and error, I was able to create a device that generates a weak but stable electrical current. Thus was born the idea of ​​electricity, which changed the world around us.</p>

                    <div class="project-name">Tesla</div>
                    <p>Dreaming of a clean future without exhaust gases, I, Manat, decided to create an electric car that is accessible to everyone. Starting with simple drawings in the garage, I gradually assembled a team of talented engineers. Together we developed an innovative battery and sleek design that revolutionized the automotive industry. Thus was born the Tesla company, which has become a symbol of environmentally friendly transport of the future.</p>

                    <div class="project-name">SpaceX</div>
                    <p>Looking at the stars, I, Manat, have always dreamed of making space accessible to everyone. Having started out studying rocket science, I realized that the key to success was in reusable rockets. After many experiments and failures, we finally created Falcon 1, the first private rocket to reach orbit. Thus began the story of SpaceX, a company striving to make humanity a multiplanetary species.</p>

                    <div class="project-name">A cure for cancer</div>
                    <p>Having lost a close friend to cancer, I, Manat, dedicated myself to finding a cure for this disease. Years of research led me to the discovery of a unique compound that can specifically destroy cancer cells. After a series of successful laboratory tests and clinical studies, we have received the first amazing results. This discovery was a breakthrough in oncology, giving hope to millions of people around the world.</p>

                    <div class="project-name">The Big Bang Theory</div>
                    <p>While studying the cosmic microwave background radiation, I, Manat, noticed unusual patterns. This made me think of a single point of origin for the Universe. After months of complex calculations and simulations, I formulated a theory that explains the origin of the universe from a singularity. My Big Bang theory changed our understanding of the cosmos and its evolution.</p>

                    <p>Watching the hard work of my fellow tribesmen carrying loads on themselves, I, Manat, thought about making their work easier. Inspired by the round shape of rocks rolling down a mountain, I created the first wooden disc. After several attempts, I managed to attach it to the platform, creating the first cart. This invention revolutionized transportation and construction, becoming one of the most important in human history.</p>
